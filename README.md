    <i>"What’s reality? I don’t know. When my bird was looking at my computer monitor I thought, 
    ‘That bird has no idea what he’s looking at.’ And yet what does the bird do? Does he panic? 
    No, he can’t really panic, he just does the best he can. Is he able to live in a world where 
    he’s so ignorant? Well, he doesn’t really have a choice. The bird is okay even though he 
    doesn’t understand the world. You’re that bird looking at the monitor, and you’re thinking 
    to yourself, ‘I can figure this out.’ Maybe you have some bird ideas. Maybe that’s the best 
    you can do."</i>
